I'm a student at Southern University of Science and Technology. My advisers are Stavros Garoufalidis and Ingrid Irmer. I have a profound interest in geometric topology and quantum topology. Currently, I'm delving into research related to Morse functions and moduli spaces. It's a challenging yet rewarding journey, as I try to understand the intricate relationships within these mathematical objects and their applications in broader theoretical frameworks. I'm excited about the potential insights this research could bring and look forward to contributing to the field.
